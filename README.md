# home-config

Repo to centralize various config files across work and home linux machines.

At the top-level are files meant to live in the $HOME directory. An easy way to symlink these to their intended location is by running `setup.sh`


## Miscellany

In addition to the symlinks generated by the setup script, here are some other steps that require a bit more user-touch to configure

1. Remove the login failure delay:
Comment out lines similar to the following:
```
# /etc/pam.d/login
#auth       optional   pam_faildelay.so  delay=3000000
```
And append "nodelay" to the line similar to the following:
```
# /etc/pam.d/common-auth
auth    [success=2 default=ignore]  pam_unix.so nullok
```
